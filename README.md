# NerdBot

NerdBot is an Op that enables a team to manage their daily Standups and provides visibility into a team's progress.

In Agile-based software development, a daily Scrum is a pivotal tool that can help organize a team to ensure that the team is on track and adapting to changing requirements.

NerdBot allows a team to conduct daily Standups completely online using Slack. The questions are completely configurable to suit the specific requirements of the team.
The Op also provides the team lead or team members visibility into the whole team's progress, which other teams can track if necessary.

## Requirements
To run this or any other Op, install the [Ops Platform](https://cto.ai/platform).

Find information about how to run and build Ops via the [Ops Platform Documentation](https://cto.ai/docs/overview).

## Usage
1. A team lead would use:
```
/ops run cto.ai/nerdbot:lead
```
to ping specific people in a Slack channel (or use Slack's @here/@channel).

2. The output of running the above version tells those pinged to run the following:
```
/ops run cto.ai/nerdbot
```
This will prompt each team member with questions regarding their progress. The answers are then printed to the Slack channel for visibility to the whole team.
